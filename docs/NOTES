rotation 0 is facing right

pathfinding
    have pathfinder in orbit wait until starting position is correct before accelerating
    taking off and landing

UI
    have each step in ship's planned future show, one after another

    have text for pathfinding state, AWAITING, CALCING, NO FOUND, EXECUTING. Have pathfinder auto reject any attempts to enter orbits of planetoids class 3 and greater (unless I come up with a better heuristic)
    
    NCIS "enhance" sort of thing for zooming? Like you select a rectangle then it stutters forwards?

    F1 rules encylopedia. hyperlinks, info on buildings/ships/upgrades available only after the first one is built, otherwise just a blank page. Could work into console idea

    UI console, to report events/numbers to make game rules more transparent without having to make a good UI?

gameplay
    have time be a resource. Can build buildings to increase the length of turns, or spend Fundamentium to pause. Processed Fundamentium for time purposes: qiblets

    takeoff - have larger planets cost more fuel to take off

    boosters - one-use acceleration

    trajectory planner - plan any number of steps into the future
